 
1.	What does the `whoami` command tell you?
    
    a.	Displays my username: `netID`


2.	What does the `pwd` command tell you?
    
    a.	Prints the current working directory


`mkdir newdir` created a new directory named `newdir`


3.	What does the `touch` command do?
    
    a.	`touch newdir/file2.txt` created a new file in the `newdir` directory named `file2.txt`


`cd newdir` changed the current working directory to `newdir`


`ls -l` shows a list of files and directories with information about them
 
 
4.	You can type `cd ~` from any directory in a Linux file system and the outcome will be the same. Why?
    
    a.	`cd ~` brought me back to my home (`netID`) directory, meaning if you type it while in any directory you will be brought home.
 

5.	What does `cd ..` do? Why does `cd .` not appear to do anything?
    
    a.	`cd .` indicates the current working directory
    
    b.	`cd ..` indicates the parent of the current working directory


`touch` created `newfile.txt` in the parent directory
 

6.	What does the `wget` command do?
    
    a.	`wget` downloads files over HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP. In this case, I downloaded the website example.org and an image from placekitten.com


`more index.html` shows proper text (HTML code), while `more 300` shows seemingly random characters. This is because at its core `index.html` is a text document, while `300` is a picture.


`300` is a .jpeg image. While renaming, the extension should stay .jpeg.
